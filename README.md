# c-examples
A git repo containing different examples written in the C programming language. Inspired by [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/), [Beej's Guide to C Programming](https://beej.us/guide/bgc/html/multi/index.html), and many other helpful websites and tutorials. This repo is directed at those who already know how to program, or those that have used C but may need a refresher.

### Compiling

You can compile the code with any C compiler that supports the ISO [C90](https://www.pdf-archive.com/2014/10/02/ansi-iso-9899-1990-1/ansi-iso-9899-1990-1.pdf) standard.

All code that can be compiled has been compiled with `gcc -std='c90'`

### Bugs/Comments

If there are any bugs in the code or information that is incorrect, please submit a PR, an issue via GitHub, or email me (my current email address can be found [here](https://www.coltonhurst.com/). I'm not amazing at C, but I'm doing this so I can understand it better. I appreciate all constructive help and feedback!

### Case Examples List

These are more... "eccentric" examples of behavior in C (Most probably work just as intended, but they may not make immediate sense to the programmer). I'll do my best to explain them, but you should definitely research these on your own, and correct me when I explain things incorrectly.
