# c-examples
A git repo containing different examples written in the C programming language. Inspired by [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/), [Beej's Guide to C Programming](https://beej.us/guide/bgc/html/multi/index.html), and many other helpful websites and tutorials. This repo is directed at those who already know how to program, or those that have used C but may need a refresher.

### Compiling

You can compile the code with any C compiler that supports the [C90](https://www.pdf-archive.com/2014/10/02/ansi-iso-9899-1990-1/ansi-iso-9899-1990-1.pdf) C standard.

All code has been tested compiled with `gcc -std='c90'`

### Bugs/Comments

If there are any bugs in the code or information that is incorrect, please submit a PR, an issue via GitHub, or email me (my current email address can be found [here](https://www.coltonhurst.com/). I'm not amazing at C, but I'm doing this so I can understand it better. I appreciate all constructive help and feedback!
