# c-examples
A git repo containing different examples written in the C programming language. Inspired by [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/), [Beej's Guide to C Programming](https://beej.us/guide/bgc/html/multi/index.html), and many other helpful websites and tutorials. This repo is directed at those who already know how to program, or those that have used C but may need a refresher.

### Compiling

You can compile the code with any C compiler that supports the [C90](https://www.pdf-archive.com/2014/10/02/ansi-iso-9899-1990-1/ansi-iso-9899-1990-1.pdf) C standard.

All code has been tested compiled with `gcc -std='c90'`

### Bugs/Comments

If there are any bugs in the code or information that is incorrect, please submit a PR, an issue via GitHub, or email me (my current email address can be found [here](https://www.coltonhurst.com/). I'm not amazing at C, but I'm doing this so I can understand it better. I appreciate all constructive help and feedback!


### List of Examples

0. [Hello World](/examples/0_hello-world.c)
1. [Variables](/examples/1_variables.c)
2. [Operators](/examples/2_operators.c)
3. [Constants](/examples/3_constants.c)

### Case Examples

These are more... "eccentric" examples of behavior in C (Most probably work just as intended, but they may not make immediate sense to the programmer). I'll do my best to explain them, but you should definitely research these on your own, and correct me when I explain things incorrectly.
